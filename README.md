# Cyber-X-Autonomous-Reinforcement-Learning-Simulation
A browser-based simulation demonstrating Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning) in a 2D environment. The agent (drone) learns to navigate obstacles and collect resources using a reward/penalty system without pre-programmed paths.


Features:

Q-Learning Agent: Implements epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration vs. exploitation.

LIDAR Perception: Uses ray-casting logic to detect proximity to walls.

Procedural Animation: The drone's shape uses polar coordinates and sine waves to pulse and react to movement.

Physics Engine: Custom implementation of differential steering (tank controls) and momentum.

Tech Stack: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript (No external libraries), CSS3.
