📝 Cyber-X Development Roadmap

🧠 AI Improvements

[ ] Save/Load Brain: Implement localStorage so the drone saves its Q-Table and doesn't forget everything when the page refreshes.

[ ] Visualizing the Mind: Create a visual grid showing the Q-Table values so we can "see" what the drone is thinking in real-time.

[ ] Dynamic Epsilon: Make the exploration rate (epsilon) adjustable via a slider in the UI.

🎮 Gameplay Features

[ ] Predators: Add "Hunter Drones" (Red) that chase the player, forcing the AI to learn evasion.

[ ] Complex Maps: moving obstacles or maze-like structures.

[ ] Multiple Agents: Spawn 5-10 drones at once to speed up training (Swarm Intelligence).

🎨 Polish

[ ] Sound Effects: Add synth-wave sounds for thrust, collection, and collisions.

[ ] Mobile Support: Add on-screen joysticks for playing on phones.
